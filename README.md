About the Website

This website serves as my digital portfolio to introduce myself, showcase my projects, and provide ways to connect.
Some buttons (like **Facebook**, **LinkedIn** , **other Projects** etc.) currently do not have active links in this repository.  
Since this project is public, I‚Äôve kept certain personal/social links hidden for now.  

I plan to **make all links active once my portfolio projects are fully completed and deployed**.  
This ensures everything is polished and ready before making my profiles public.

# Portfolio Website

A modern, minimalist portfolio website built to showcase my projects, skills, and design philosophy.  
It highlights my journey as a **full-time student and aspiring UI/UX designer** with experience in both development and design.
